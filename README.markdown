**Not ready for use just yet :)**

A dynamic CSS framework built on top of Shaun Inman's CSS Cacheer. Favouring convention over configuration, it aims to speed up development time by reducing the number of times you need to repeat yourself. It extends into the markup to make sure everything is consistent. By standardizing the markup, it makes it extremely easy to create templates and frameworks for common items.
